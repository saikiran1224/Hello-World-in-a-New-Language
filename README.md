#MLH Local Hack Day:Build Day-1
This is a Repository containing the code of the Challenge named
**Hello,World in a new Language**. Here I have used the Java Language to show Hello, World.

## Code Written
``` //My First Java Program
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
      //Your code goes here
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}```

I am very much Happy to learn a New Language by Completing these Challenges.
